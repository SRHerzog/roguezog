### About
This game is based on a project assignment from [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). It is a bare-bones Roguelike implemented in React, with colored HTML divs in place of glyphs or images.

Gameplay is currently minimal and unbalanced, since it was a JavaScript/React assignment and not a game design assignment. However, I will be iterating on the gameplay to turn it into an interesting game eventually.

Key features:
- Procedural level generation
- Equipment upgrades
- Monster movement (monsters move randomly and will only attack when adjacent to player)
- Boss monster
- Server logging

Upcoming features:
- Darkness and scrolling
- Monster aggression (on sight or contact)
- Multiple dungeon levels
- New level designs
- More items and monsters
- Balance
- More compelling gameplay
- Ranged combat
- Reimplementation in HTML5 canvas
